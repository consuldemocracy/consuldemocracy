# CONSUL Documentation and guides

There are several guides where you can read very detailed information about CONSUL and its possibilities. You can find them all at: http://consulproject.org/en/#documentation

- **CONSUL Use Guide**. In this guide you can see different ways to use CONSUL and examples of participation processes.
- **CONSUL Administration Guide**. This guide contains detailed information on the administration and management of CONSUL.
- **CONSUL Communication Guide**. This guide can give you an initial idea of how to plan communication campaigns to invite people to use your CONSUL platform. Communication is a key issue in getting relevant participation and engagement.

In addition to these guides you can access the [CONSUL Community](http://community.consulproject.org/), a discussion space to share more documentation, questions, learning, etc.
