Right now we are defining thirty proposals in collaboration with neighbourhood and social organisations, technicians, administrations, academic institutions, social and trade associations and collectives, trade unions, business organisations and political groups. At the same time, we want our neighbours to be able to get to know them.\r\n\r\nNow is the time for you to tell us here how you think these measures would work in your street, in your neighbourhood, in your district.\r\n",
