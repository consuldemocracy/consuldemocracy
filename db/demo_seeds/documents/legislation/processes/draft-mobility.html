  <strong>STRATEGIC MOBILITY PLAN 2025-2035</strong><br />
  A better mobility starts in cities
</p>

<p>
  From our streets to Europe. The 2019-2024 EU mandate has been filled with
  landmark achievements in the sphere of EU urban mobility policy, underpinned
  by the ambitions of the European Green Deal. The task of the next EU
  policymakers will revolve around keeping the EU on track to meet its targets
  for 2030 and beyond in terms of climate, road safety, air quality, noise and
  other Green Deal objectives.
</p>

<p>
  In five years, zero-emission mobility in cities should become mainstream,
  aided by the proliferation of zero-emission vehicles and lighter
  transportation options. Preventive measures to free people from some of the
  everyday journeys that they are currently compelled to take will also
  contribute to aligning with climate mitigation and environmental health goals.
  Essential to this transition is greater EU and national support for urban and
  long-distance transport infrastructure investments based on newly available
  sustainable urban mobility indicators, with increased budget allocations,
  clarified rules applicable to urban areas and enhanced city involvement in
  decision-making.
</p>

<p>
  Creating a multimodal, convenient, and reliable mobility system will further
  encourage reconsideration of travel habits and a modal shift towards public
  transport, walking and cycling. In line with their Sustainable Urban Mobility
  Plans, city leaders aim to redesign urban spaces to improve air quality and to
  make them more welcoming, safer and more inclusive, which in turn promotes
  economic activity. The EU should support these aims with the corresponding
  policies and funding tools. In 2030, innovation will continue to drive
  mobility services, requiring proper calibration of innovation funding,
  capacity building for cities, and improved data sharing between businesses and
  governments to optimise infrastructure adaptation and planning.
</p>

<p>
  Building upon the Eurocities manifesto, the following recommendations
  contribute to achieving this vision and filling in the current EU mobility
  policy gaps in line with cities’ aspirations.

      Beyond Cities</strong

      Connecting the dots between long- and short-distance transport. Eurocities
      recommends that the EU institutions accompany the cities now termed ‘urban
      nodes’ in taking full ownership of their new role, acknowledged by the
      TEN-T regulation, by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Clarifying the role and responsibilities of urban node authorities while
        giving them a seat at the decision table of big transport investment
        plans which directly or indirectly impact their territories.
      </li>
      <li>
        Setting up a new Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) – Transport programme,
        including an increased budget for urban areas aligned with local
        priorities.
      </li>
      <li>
        Providing guidance for the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans of urban
        nodes on how to integrate land-use and infrastructure planning, taking
        into account the local, regional, and European scale.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Deliver on the EU plan to boost long-distance rail. Cities are fully
      behind the EU’s ambition to double the volume of high-speed rail traffic
      by 2030 and to revive night train and freight connections across Europe.
      To finance the ambitions, policy makers should:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Ensure that existing programmes such as the CEF-Transport programme are
        aligned with this level of ambition to ensure the development of
        high-performing, sustainable, and efficiently interconnected
        trans-European transport infrastructure for rail in Europe.
      </li>
      <li>
        Explore the implementation of cross-mode subsidies and adequate national
        taxation schemes to promote environmentally friendly modes of
        transportation, leveraging legislative tools such as the Energy Taxation
        Directive and the Eurovignette Directive.
      </li>
      <li>
        Build upon the experience of national discounted fares such as the
        Austrian KlimaTicket schemes for railway to attract new users.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Prioritising sustainable transport modes. The European institutions
      should:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Continue to support the public transport sector’s decarbonisation and
        digital solutions to support its prioritisation and integration with
        other modes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fully recognise the positive impact of public transport to be a credible
        24/7 alternative, including by safeguarding the freedom for local and
        regional authorities to set public service obligations on public
        transport.
      </li>
      <li>
        Propose a measurable implementation plan of the EU Cycling Declaration
        based on cities’ recommendations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Promote guidance and funding for traffic reduction solutions as an
        enabler for safer, more resilient and liveable cities.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Mainstreaming zero-emission mobility in cities</strong>
    <p>
      Secure the transition of the automotive sector towards zero-emissions.
      Eurocities recommends that EU policymakers:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Secure the 2035 phase-out targets for fossil-fuelled vehicles as already
        agreed at the EU level.
      </li>
      <li>
        Address vehicle categories in which decarbonisation is lagging, such as
        Non-Road Mobile Machinery.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Propose a clear set of actions to put lighter and smaller vehicles on the
      market. Eurocities recommends that the EU institutions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Address the issue by regulating vehicles’ energy efficiency, ensure that
        imported vehicles comply with EU legislation, set dimension limits and
        ensure better consumer information.
      </li>
      <li>
        Complete the applicable regulatory framework for lighter modes of
        transport, ensuring road safety and limiting their emissions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Provide continued support in research and innovation for new lighter
        vehicles for freight and passenger transport.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Enabling cities’ infrastructure for the roll-out of zero-emission
      vehicles. Eurocities recommends that EU decision makers:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Propose new funding programmes as part of the next Multi-Annual
        Financial Framework to prepare cities for the adaptation of local
        infrastructure to the roll-out of zero-emission vehicles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue to provide EU guidance to better plan zero-emission urban
        mobility during the implementation of the new EU legislation as well as
        continuous support for standardisation.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
