Asking the City Council to commit to sign the manifesto \"SUSTAINABLE CITY\" and to implement it -- We demand compliance with the following 14 points:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Develop awareness campaigns, training and promotion of energy culture in all areas of the city.</li>
	<li>To contract municipal electricity with a 100% renewable guarantee of origin.</li>
	<li>Establish a transversal work team for the preparation, execution and monitoring of strategic plans.</li>
	<li>Facilitate the obtaining on a regular basis of the energy and economic data necessary for its management.</li>
	<li>Design and implement energy efficiency actions in municipal facilities prioritizing changes in habits to eliminate wasteful consumption. The savings achieved by changing habits will be invested, in part or in full, in new energy efficiency measures.</li>
	<li>Implement energy efficiency programmes in educational centres, such as the 50/50 project -- consisting of returning 50% of the savings to the school and reverting the other half to new savings, efficiency and renewable measures in the same centre.</li>
	<li>Apply measures to combat energy poverty: processing of the social bond, etc.</li>
	<li>Design and execute all new constructions or municipal works with criteria of almost zero energy consumption.</li>
	<li>Implement sustainable mobility actions: promotion of public transport, use of sustainable vehicles, pedestrianisation of streets, etc.</li>
	<li>Design a plan to gradually replace the entire fleet of vehicles dedicated to public transport and municipal vehicles with electric vehicles.</li>
	<li>Establish fiscal measures to promote energy efficiency and renewable energies.</li>
	<li>Revise municipal by-laws to favour self-sufficient energy systems based on renewable energies.</li>
	<li>Generate a sustainable urban model by stopping speculative processes.</li>
	<li>Make a sustainable management of Urban Solid Waste.</li>

                              description: "<p>\"Children need time and space to play. Play is not a luxury, it is a necessity\" Kay Redfield.</p>

<p>Play is fundamental to children's health, development and well-being. Play is a right under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (art. 31), yet it is one of the most neglected and forgotten. Today, children play half as long as their parents did at their age, with consequences for their physical and mental health. Therefore, we propose these concrete measures to guarantee the right to play in Madrid.</p>

<p>PLAY OUTDOOR: in parks, squares, streets and courtyards Ensure playgrounds are well maintained, clean and have shaded areas. Design new parks and renovate existing ones using materials from nature to promote creativity and free play and ensure that they are inclusive, accessible, sustainable, safe and intergenerational. Reclaim squares as intergenerational meeting spaces, playgrounds and recreation areas within the city. To recover the streets as play spaces, adapting European good practices such as proposing the closing of one street per neighbourhood to traffic for community use and for children, temporarily or permanently as requested by the neighbourhood. Create safe school paths for all schools. Progressively renovate schoolyards so that they are creative, inclusive spaces, with an element of nature, co-designed with children and key actors.</p>

<p>PLAY INDOORS: Create a network of municipal toy libraries as a refuge to continue playing when weather conditions make it difficult to play outdoors. Create and/or set up indoor and air-conditioned play areas in sports centres, cultural centres and other underused buildings, in all neighbourhoods of Madrid, for children of all ages, gender, accessible, inclusive and safe. Create a pilot project: Covered Municipal Free Play Space. Ensure a space dedicated to upbringing per neighbourhood with sufficient capacity to meet the needs of babies, boys and girls from 0 to 3.</p>

<p>THE RIGHT TO PLAY FOR ALL: Incorporate 1 m2/inhabitant for play in the sustainable urban planning of the municipality to create, recover or expand play areas in the city. Provide the main cultural and leisure centres in each district with accessible, inclusive, sustainable and safe play areas for girls and boys. Decentralize leisure and cultural activities in all neighbourhoods/districts and ensure their free and/or accessibility.</p>

<p>Allow healthy play by applying air quality measures in children's play areas. Include children in the design and evaluation of new public play spaces.</p>",

<p>One cannot walk quietly on the road because, let us be realistic, we hinder traffic and we are a scourge to car drivers.
