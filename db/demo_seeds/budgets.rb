If we take into account that less than 14,000 people receive the Minimum Income of Insertion, we see that the population that cannot afford a basic diet is more than double that which receives economic aid from the Autonomous Community. This shows that the Community's aid does not reach all the people who need it either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent years, night-time queues of people waiting to pick up waste from supermarkets have become commonplace in working-class neighbourhoods. New neighbourhood food collection and distribution networks have also emerged, a clear symptom of the inadequacy of public policies and the overflow of traditional NGOs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We consider that Participatory Budgets can be an opportunity to reach objectives of coverage of needs not reached until now, and to offer a definitive support to people and families that do not reach their autonomy and well-being because the existing aids are not sufficient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our proposal consists of fully allocating the 30 million euros of the Participatory Budgets to an economic aid programme to eradicate food poverty in the city. This would mean contributing 0.6% of the City Council Budget to satisfy a basic need of 1% of the population, the most vulnerable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We invite you to massively support this proposal to eradicate this social stigma and as a way of demonstrating to Public Administrations that what citizens demand in the first place is that basic human rights be guaranteed. </p>\r\n",

  heading.investments.create!(title: "District International Blues Festival",
                              description: "<p>We believe that the city deserves an international Blues festival as it is held in other cities. The musical offer is wide and, especially in the months of spring to autumn, there are a lot of live music activities. However, Blues is in a position of inferiority to other musical styles, as it has enjoyed little institutional support for its promotion. That is why we are making this proposal, a Festival that will be free and will feature leading figures of national and international Blues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year we had the opportunity to organize a Blues festival with musicians, which was developed with great success. This fact, together with the flourishing associative and cultural activity of the District in the last years, encourages us to propose this International Festival taking advantage of the existing municipal spaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its realization could serve as a means to create in the district a cultural circuit with a stable cultural program, as it provides for the exploitation of synergies with other associations, seeking their participation and collaboration. The event will also have economic advantages for the District and for the city, as this type of event attracts fans, with the consequent increase in activity, especially in the services sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Festival will include musical and children's activities, a conference, a documentary screening, a master class and an exhibition, with the aim of presenting a broad programme aimed at all audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Calendar: SpringFriday 24 and Saturday 25 May + Friday 31 May, Saturday 1 and Sunday 2 June</p>\r\n",
