###### Application monitoring services ######
#
# By default Consul Democracy supports the Errbit self-hosted error monitoring
# service, through the Airbrake gem. That means Consul Democracy also supports
# using Airbrake as an external service to monitor errors and application
# performance.
#
# Here are some other services which can be used to monitor application errors
# and performance.

# Newrelic is an external service which helps you monitor the application
# performance
# gem "newrelic_rpm", "insert_gem_version_here"

# Sentry is an external or self-hosted service which helps you monitor the
# application errors and performance
# gem "sentry-ruby", "insert_gem_version_here"

# Rollbar is an external service which helps you monitor the application errors
# gem "rollbar", "insert_gem_version_here"
