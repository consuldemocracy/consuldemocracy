      recommendation_one: "On the Internet it is easy to say things you would not dare to say face to face. The tone of what you say you will be matched by a similar tone in the answers."
      recommendation_two: "Do not write the title of the debate or whole sentences in capital. On the Internet this is considered shouting. And nobody likes to scream."
      recommendation_three: "Any discussion or comment that involves an illegal act will be eliminated, also intending to sabotage the debate spaces, everything else is permitted."
      recommendation_four: "The harsh criticism are very welcome. This is a space of thought but we recommend preserving the elegance and intelligence. The world is better with them present."
      recommendation_five: "Enjoy this space, voices that fill it, it is yours too."
