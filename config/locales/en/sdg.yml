The majority of people living on less than $1.90 a day live in sub-Saharan Africa. Worldwide, the <a href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2019/goal-01/">poverty rate in rural areas is 17.2 per cent</a>—more than three times higher than in urban areas.&nbsp;</p> <p>For those who work, having a job does not guarantee a decent living.
