To check this feature, please check the tenants in %{tenants_link}.</p><p>The reason you can't change the enabled languages on the main tenant is so people visiting the main tenant can always immediately know which languages are available in Consul Democracy.</p>In a regular Consul Democracy installation, you can also change the enabled languages for the main tenant.</p>"
