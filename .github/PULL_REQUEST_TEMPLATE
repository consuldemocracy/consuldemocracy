**Here's a quick summary of some points to check**

* Include specs to test any changes you've made
* Our CI will check whether the rest of the application is still working properly; check its build and make sure all tests are passing
* Run `bundle exec pronto run` and fix any issues it reports; these issues will also be automatically reported on the pull request
* Follow [the seven rules of a great commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
* Add or modify i18n translations only in the base languages, English (en) and Spanish (es); we manage all other languages through the [Crowdin integration](https://translate.consuldemocracy.org/).
