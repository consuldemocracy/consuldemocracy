       for an open, transparent and democratic government.

    longDescription: >
      Consul Democracy is a Free and Open-Source software for digital and hybrid participation.
      From 2016 onwards, governments and other public organizations from across the globe started using it, implementing one or
      several of its main features or customizing the software further, allowed under the Affero GPL version 3 license.
      Currently the CONSUL DEMOCRACY community consists of around 250 cities, regional governments, and regional and tech partners.
      The Consul-project was originally developed for the Madrid City Government, and now is maintained by
      the Consul Democracy Foundation and its community.
